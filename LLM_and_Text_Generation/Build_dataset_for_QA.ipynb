Users are advised to install the applicable firmware updates for optimal protection. What is the vulnerability? A hardcoded credential vulnerability was identified in the “zyfwp” user account in some Zyxel firewalls and AP controllers. The account was designed to deliver automatic firmware updates to connected access points through FTP. What versions are vulnerable—and what should you do? After a thorough investigation, we’ve identified the vulnerable products and are releasing firmware patches to address the issue, as shown in the table below. For optimal protection, we urge users to install the applicable updates. For those not listed, they are not affected. Contact your local Zyxel support team if you require further assistance or visit our  forum  for more information. Got a question or a tipoff? Please contact your local service rep for further information or assistance. If you’ve found a vulnerability, we want to work with you to fix it—contact  security@zyxel.com.tw  and we’ll get right back to you. Acknowledgment Thanks to Niels Teusink at EYE for reporting the issue to us. Revision history 2020-12-23: Initial release 2020-12-24: Updated the acknowledgement section 2021-01-04: Updated the patch schedule for AP controllers 2021-01-08: Added the forum link',\n",

       " 'context': 'CVE:   CVE-2020-29583 Summary Zyxel has released a patch for the hardcoded credential vulnerability of firewalls and AP controllers recently reported by researchers from EYE Netherlands. Users are advised to install the applicable firmware updates for optimal protection. What is the vulnerability? A hardcoded credential vulnerability was identified in the “zyfwp” user account in some Zyxel firewalls and AP controllers. The account was designed to deliver automatic firmware updates to connected access points through FTP. What versions are vulnerable—and what should you do? After a thorough investigation, we’ve identified the vulnerable products and are releasing firmware patches to address the issue, as shown in the table below. For optimal protection, we urge users to install the applicable updates. For those not listed, they are not affected. Contact your local Zyxel support team if you require further assistance or visit our  forum  for more information. Got a question or a tipoff? Please contact your local service rep for further information or assistance. If you’ve found a vulnerability, we want to work with you to fix it—contact  security@zyxel.com.tw  and we’ll get right back to you. Acknowledgment Thanks to Niels Teusink at EYE for reporting the issue to us. Revision history 2020-12-23: Initial release 2020-12-24: Updated the acknowledgement section 2021-01-04: Updated the patch schedule for AP controllers 2021-01-08: Added the forum link',\n",
