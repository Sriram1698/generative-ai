      "A live-action Barbie film was announced in September 2009 by Universal Pictures with Laurence Mark producing. Development began in April 2014, when Sony Pictures acquired the film rights. Following multiple writer and director changes and the casting of Amy Schumer and later Anne Hathaway as Barbie, the rights were transferred to Warner Bros. Pictures in October 2018. Robbie was cast in 2019, after Gal Gadot turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts, and Gerwig was announced as director and co-writer with Baumbach in 2020. The rest of the cast was announced in early 2022. Principal photography occurred primarily at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, England, and at the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles from March to July 2022.\n",
      "Barbie premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, and was released in the United States on July 21. Its concurrent release with Universal Pictures' Oppenheimer was the catalyst of the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. The film grossed $1.447 billion and achieved several milestones, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2023 and the 14th highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release.\n",
      "Plot:\n",
      "A \"stereotypical\" Barbie and fellow dolls reside in Barbieland, a matriarchal society populated by different versions of Barbie, Ken, and a group of discontinued models who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits. While the Kens spend their days playing at the beach, considering it their profession, the Barbies hold prestigious jobs in law, science, politics, and so on. Ken (\"Beach Ken\") is only happy when he is with Barbie, and he seeks a closer relationship with her, but she rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships.\n",
      "One evening at a dance party, Barbie is suddenly stricken with worries about mortality. Overnight, she develops bad breath, cellulite, and flat feet, disrupting her routines and impairing the aura of classic perfection experienced by the Barbies. Weird Barbie, a disfigured doll, tells Barbie to find the child playing with her in the real world to cure her afflictions. Barbie follows the advice and she travels to the real world, with Beach Ken joining her by stowing away in her convertible.\n",
      "After arriving in Venice Beach, Barbie punches a man for groping her, and is briefly arrested, and then she and Ken are both arrested after not paying for new clothes. Alarmed by the dolls' presence in the real world, the CEO of Mattel orders their recapture. Barbie tracks down her owner, a teenage girl named Sasha, who criticizes Barbie for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards. Distraught, Barbie discovers that Gloria, a Mattel employee and Sasha's mother, inadvertently caused Barbie's existential crisis after starting to play with Sasha's old Barbie dolls and drawing Barbie dolls with dark emotions and thoughts. Mattel finds Barbie and attempts to put her in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with the help of a mysterious elderly woman named Ruth. Gloria and Sasha arrive just in time to rescue Barbie from Mattel's executives, and the three travel to Barbieland with the executives in pursuit. Meanwhile, Ken learns about patriarchy and feels respected for the first time. He returns to Barbieland to persuade the other Kens to take it over. The Kens begin to indoctrinate the Barbies into submissive roles, such as agreeable girlfriends, housewives, and maids. Barbie arrives and attempts to convince the Barbies to be independent again, but becomes depressed when she fails. Gloria expresses her frustration with the conflicting standards that women are forced to follow in the real world, and her speech restores Barbie's confidence.\n",
      "With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Allan, and the discontinued dolls, Gloria uses her knowledge from the real world to deprogram the Barbies from their indoctrination. The Barbies then manipulate the Kens into fighting among themselves, which distracts them from enshrining male superiority into Barbieland's constitution, allowing the Barbies to regain power. Having now experienced systemic oppression for themselves, the Barbies resolve to rectify the faults of their previous society, emphasizing better treatment of the Kens and all outcasts. Barbie and Ken make amends, acknowledging their past mistakes. When Ken bemoans his lack of purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find an autonomous identity. Barbie, who remains unsure of her own identity, meets with the spirit of Ruth Handler, Mattel co-founder and creator of the Barbie doll, who explains that Barbie's story has no set ending and her ever-evolving history surpasses her roots.\n",
      "After bidding goodbye to the other dolls and Mattel executives, Barbie decides to become human again and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband, and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name \"Barbara Handler\", to her first gynecologist appointment.\n",

      "        === START MOVIE PLOT SUMMARY FOR Oppenheimer ===\n",
      "        Overview:\n",
      "Oppenheimer is a 2023 epic biographical thriller film written, co-produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. It follows the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who helped develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film dramatizes Oppenheimer's studies, his direction of the Los Alamos Laboratory and his 1954 security hearing. Cillian Murphy stars as Oppenheimer, alongside Robert Downey Jr. as the United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss. The ensemble supporting cast includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.\n",
      "Oppenheimer was announced in September 2021. It was Nolan's first film not distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures since Memento (2000), due to his conflicts regarding the studio's simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release schedule. Murphy was the first cast member to join, with the rest joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production began by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. The cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, selected scenes in IMAX black-and-white film photography. As with many of his previous films, Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimal compositing.\n",
      "Oppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21 by Universal Pictures. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'s Barbie was the catalyst of the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. Oppenheimer received critical acclaim and grossed $975 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II–related film, the highest-grossing biographical film and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film of all time at the time of its release.\n",
      "The recipient of many accolades, Oppenheimer was nominated for thirteen awards at the 96th Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture, Best Director (Nolan), Best Actor (Murphy), and Best Supporting Actor (Downey). It also won five Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture – Drama) and seven British Academy Film Awards (including Best Film), and was named one of the top 10 films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.\n",
      "Plot:\n",
      "In 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying experimental quantum physics under Patrick Blackett at the University of Cambridge in England. Oppenheimer clashes with Blackett, leaving him a poisoned apple, but he later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr advises Oppenheimer to study theoretical physics at the University of Göttingen in Germany.\n",
      "Oppenheimer completes his PhD and meets scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi. They later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer teaches at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. He marries Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled communist psychiatrist whose death appears to be a suicide.\n",
      "When nuclear fission is discovered in 1938, after the Germans succeed in splitting the atom, Oppenheimer realizes it can be weaponized. In 1942, during World War II, U.S. Army Colonel Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, recruits Oppenheimer as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer fears the German nuclear research program, led by Heisenberg, might yield a fission bomb for the Nazis sooner. Oppenheimer assembles a team consisting of Rabi, Hans Bethe, and Edward Teller, and collaborates with the scientists Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, and David L. Hill at the University of Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could destroy the world; after consulting with Albert Einstein and having Bethe do his own calculations on the matter, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are \"near zero\". Teller attempts to leave the project after his proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is rejected, but Oppenheimer convinces him to stay.\n",
      "After Germany's surrender in 1945, some scientists question the bomb's relevance. Oppenheimer believes it would end the ongoing Pacific War and save lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, resulting in Japan's surrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is guilt-ridden and haunted by the destruction and mass fatalities. After Oppenheimer expresses his remorse to Truman, the president accepts responsibility for ordering the bombings, but also berates him and dismisses his plea to cease further atomic development. As an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning Cold War. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for publicly dismissing Strauss's concerns about exporting radioactive isotopes and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after the Soviets successfully detonate their own bomb. Strauss also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947.\n",
      "In 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private security hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning the renewal of Oppenheimer's Q clearance, during which his loyalty to the United States is questioned. However, the hearing is a kangaroo court. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are raised and his associates' testimony is twisted against him, with Teller's being the most damaging. After Kitty vigorously defends herself and her husband, the board no longer suspects Oppenheimer of disloyalty but still revokes his clearance, thereby damaging his public image and limiting his influence on American nuclear policy. In 1959, during Strauss's Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill unexpectedly testifies about Strauss's personal motives for engineering Oppenheimer's downfall. Strauss's nomination is narrowly voted down, with the deciding vote against Strauss given by the Senator of Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy, enraging him. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award. Flashing back to their 1947 conversation, Oppenheimer expresses to Einstein his belief that he had caused a chain reaction that would one day destroy the world.\n",

      "        Overview:\n",
      "The Notebook is a 2004 American romantic drama film directed by Nick Cassavetes, from a screenplay by Jeremy Leven and Jan Sardi, and based on the 1996 novel by Nicholas Sparks. The film stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as a young couple who fall in love in the 1940s. Their story is read from a notebook in the modern day by an elderly man, telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident.\n",
      "The Notebook had its world premiere at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 20, 2004, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 25, 2004. Despite generally mixed reviews from critics, Gosling and McAdams were singled out for praise for their performances. The film was a sleeper hit at the box office, grossing $117 million against its $29 million budget, and has become a cult classic in the years since its release. On November 11, 2012, an extended version premiered on ABC Family with deleted scenes added back into the original storyline.\n",
      "The film earned several accolades, including the MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss for Gosling and McAdams at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. At the 11th Screen Actors Guild Awards, James Garner was nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role and the director's mother, Gena Rowlands, won Best Supporting Actress – Drama at the 9th Golden Satellite Awards.\n",
      "Plot:\n",
      "In 2004, an elderly man named Duke reads a romantic story from a notebook to a female patient in a nursing home. The notebook recounts the love story of Noah Calhoun and Allison \"Allie\" Hamilton.\n",
      "In 1940, at a carnival in Seabrook Island, South Carolina, lumber mill worker Noah sees 17-year-old heiress Allie, who is visiting for the summer. Noah immediately falls in love with Allie and pursues her, but Allie is unimpressed with him. However, he eventually woos her into dating him and they begin a romance. Over the summer, the pair fall madly in love, despite their different social classes.\n",
      "Near the end of the summer, Noah discovers that Allie will be attending Sarah Lawrence College in New York. He takes her to the Windsor Plantation, telling her about his dream to repair the abandoned building. They begin to have sex, but are interrupted by their friend Fin, who tells them that Allie's parents have called the police to look for her. Allie's mother Anne makes it clear she is against the relationship and forbids her from seeing him. Having overheard the conversation, Noah admits that he does not see a future for them. A distraught Allie breaks up with him, but immediately regrets the decision.\n",
      "The next morning, Anne announces they will be returning to Charleston immediately, one week earlier than planned. Allie rushes to the lumber mill to apologize to Noah, but he is away. Allie asks Fin to tell Noah she loves him. Noah rushes to Allie's home when the message is delivered, but is too late.\n",
      "Noah writes Allie every day for a year, but Allie's mother intercepts the letters. With no responses from her, Noah believes Allie no longer wants to be with him and stops sending letters. When World War II erupts, Noah and Fin enlist and fight in the Battle of the Bulge, where Fin is killed. Meanwhile, Allie nurses wounded soldiers in a hospital and ends up meeting Captain Lon Hammond Jr., a young lawyer who comes from old Southern money. Allie and Lon fall in love and become engaged, to Allie's parents' delight.\n",
      "When Noah returns from the war, he finds his father has sold their home so Noah can buy the Windsor Plantation. Soon after, his father dies, and Noah begins repairing the house. Noah plans to sell the house, but always finds excuses not to sell to any potential buyer. Noah has a casual relationship with a war widow named Martha Shaw. Martha wants more from Noah, but he is not over his heartbreak with Allie.\n",
      "Allie excitedly tries on wedding dresses with her mother and friends, but then sees a photo of Noah at Windsor Plantation in the newspaper and faints. Allie's feelings for Noah resurface and she realizes she needs to see him one last time before she marries Lon. Allie tells Lon she needs some time for herself and travels to Seabrook alone. There, she goes to Windsor Plantation, and comes face-to-face with Noah for the first time in seven years. Noah is stunned to see her and a nervous Allie tries to leave, but accidentally crashes her car. Noah invites Allie inside, where they have a pleasant conversation and she informs him of her engagement. The pair also reminisce about their time together and how in love they were.\n",
      "The next day, they go for a boat ride on the lake, where Noah shows Allie a beautiful spot with geese. It begins to rain and when they return to the dock, Allie emotionally questions Noah why he never wrote to her and that she waited for him for seven years. Noah tells Allie he wrote her 365 letters—one letter everyday for a year. Noah declares things are not over between them and passionately kisses Allie. They go back to the house and have sex. \n",
      "Noah and Allie rekindle their relationship and spend the next couple of days in romantic bliss. At one point, Martha arrives at the house and is happy to see that Noah is finally with his true love. Anne arrives to warn Allie that Lon has come to Seabrook. Allie is angry with her mother for keeping the letters from Noah from her. Anne takes Allie to the lumber mill and points out a man she once also loved. Anne explains that since he was lower-class she believed they had no future and she still wonders what their lives would have been like had she chosen differently. She gives Noah's letters to Allie, which she has kept, and suggests she choose wisely.\n",
      "Upon returning to the house, Noah questions Allie about what she is going to do. When Allie can't give him an answer, it leads to an explosive argument. Noah feels betrayed that Allie is leaving him again after they slept together. Allie reminds Noah she is still engaged to Lon. Noah asks Allie to stay with him, but Allie isn't sure she and Noah can make things work. Noah acknowledges that their relationship won't be easy, but that he is willing to put in the effort because he wants to be with her forever. Allie is torn since whatever choice she makes she will end up hurting Noah or Lon. Noah tells her she has to choose who she truly wants to be with, regardless of the consequences. She drives back to her hotel, sobbing and confused after having read the letters. After a clarifying conversation with Lon, Allie follows her heart and returns to Noah.\n",
      "Back in 2004, the elderly woman is revealed to be Allie, now suffering from dementia. Duke is actually Noah, who uses a pseudonym to not startle her in her disoriented state. The book he reads to her is her journal, detailing their romance and life together so he could help her remember him. Noah has kept his promise to read it to her daily.\n",
      "When Noah finishes reading the notebook, Allie remembers it is their story. She finally recognizes Noah and they embrace. They dance to their song, \"I'll Be Seeing You\", and she asks about their children. However, Allie's dementia quickly returns and she panics at seeing a stranger touching her, so she is sedated. Later, Duke has a heart attack and is treated in the nursing home while Allie is taken to the dementia ward. Upon his recovery, Noah sneaks into Allie's room in the night while the nurse turns a blind eye. Allie instantly recognizes him and they kiss, declaring that she doesn't want to forget and wants them to \"leave\" together. The next morning, their bodies are found together, holding hands.\n",

      "        === START MOVIE PLOT SUMMARY FOR Dumb Money ===\n",
      "        Overview:\n",
      "Dumb Money is a 2023 American biographical comedy-drama film, directed by Craig Gillespie and written by Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo. It is based on the 2021 book The Antisocial Network by Ben Mezrich and chronicles the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Paul Dano, Pete Davidson, Vincent D'Onofrio, America Ferrera, Nick Offerman, Anthony Ramos, Sebastian Stan, Shailene Woodley, and Seth Rogen.\n",
      "After being filmed in New Jersey from October to November 2022, Dumb Money premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2023. It was released in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing in select theaters on September 15, 2023, and wide release on September 29, 2023. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $20 million worldwide.\n",
      "Plot:\n",
      "Keith Gill is a middle-class man working as a financial analyst in Brockton, Massachusetts. During his spare time, he regularly frequents the stock market subreddit r/WallStreetBets, posting his opinions via YouTube live streams under the name Roaring Kitty. He struggles to provide for his family, and his brother Kevin constantly mocks his YouTube work as nerdy garbage.\n",
      "In July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Keith notices that video game retailer GameStop's stock is falling. He sinks his life savings into buying stock in it, regularly live-streaming updates with his viewers. Despite Kevin and several peers claiming this is a waste of time, by January 2021, activity on r/WallStreetBets reveals that several hedge fund investment firms, including Melvin Capital Management and its founder Gabe Plotkin, have been short selling stock in the chain on the assumption GameStop would close. But, aggressive GameStop stock purchases by Keith and other online stock buyers – including struggling nurse Jennifer, GameStop retail employee Marcos, and lesbian University of Texas at Austin couple Riri and Harmony – caused a mass increase in GameStop's overall stock price. As a result, Plotkin and other investment CEOs lost hundreds of millions of dollars within the same time frame. Keith is heralded as a financial guru.\n",
      "Things take a turn when r/WallStreetBets is temporarily shut down for \"inflammatory and vulgar content\", causing a mass surge of panic selling in GameStop's stock in an attempt to beat a perceived price drop. When the commission-free stock trading website Robinhood is unable to pay the money for the sales adequately, co-chairman Vlad Tenev, at the behest of Citadel LLC owner Ken Griffin, halts all purchasing of GameStop's stock until Robinhood shores up adequate capital to cover outstanding NSCC requirements created due to the level of purchases. They raise the $3–4 billion necessary, but the subsequent negative backlash results in an investigation by the United States House Committee on Financial Services, with Tenev, Griffin, Plotkin, and Keith all being subpoenaed, the former three for their roles in the fiasco and the latter on suspicion of using the situation to trick the public into making himself rich. As the investors struggle to defend their actions, Keith adamantly denies any wrongdoing, stating he was only doing what anyone with a passing awareness of investment banking would do in that situation.\n",
      "In the aftermath, post text shows how several of the individuals were affected: Plotkin was forced to shut down Melvin Capital because of the net losses the incident caused; Robinhood was the target of several lawsuits following the fiasco and wound up starting in the stock market significantly lower than it was prior; Harmony was able to use the money she obtained to pay off her family's debt issues and continues her relationship with Riri; Marcos sold half of his GameStop stock and quit his position in the company; Jennifer remains in debt but has retained her shareholding; Keith retired from YouTube in late April to get out of the public eye and sold part of his stocks to get Kevin an expensive car as a way to stop his nagging about how he will not loan him his car for his food deliveries.\n",
